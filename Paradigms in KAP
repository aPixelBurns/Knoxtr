Universe 1: Nash Equilibrium Token Metabolism

This universe assumes that all participants and actions converge to an automatic equilibrium, where token use aligns with individual incentives while optimizing collective outcomes.

Key Principles:
	•	Mutual Alignment: Token dynamics naturally balance individual gain and DAO efficiency.
	•	Stability via Iteration: Actions iteratively stabilize the token supply and demand in decision-making.

Pathways:
	1.	Participation Incentives:
	•	Token Earned:
	•	Submitting valuable ideas or proposals.
	•	Participating in deliberations or voting processes.
	•	Fulfilling DAO-assigned roles or bounties.
	•	Token Burned:
	•	Submissions with low validation (spam, off-topic, or harmful).
	•	Accessing high-value tools (premium namespaces, rooms).
	2.	Governance and Voting:
	•	Token Earned:
	•	Voting on proposals that align with guild-defined KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).
	•	Stakeholders earn proportional Amethyst when supporting consensus.
	•	Token Burned:
	•	Cost for proposal submission, scaled by the proposal’s scope or priority.
	•	Burned for stake challenges or invalidation attempts.
	3.	Reputation and Trust Mechanisms:
	•	Token Earned:
	•	Contributions validated by high-reputation peers.
	•	Long-term engagement without entropy (e.g., abstaining from harmful or invalid actions).
	•	Token Burned:
	•	Rebuilding lost reputation after governance infractions.
	4.	Project Funding and Yield:
	•	Token Earned:
	•	Stake tokens in Passive Yield Pools for DAO treasury growth (e.g., Snapmint distributions).
	•	Completion of funding milestones with peer validation.
	•	Token Burned:
	•	Raising funds for new initiatives (proposal submission fee).
	•	Failure to meet milestones or deliverables.

End State:

Over time, token metabolism develops a flywheel of engagement, where users are incentivized to actively contribute valuable resources, aligning their incentives with the DAO’s success.

Universe 2: Adaptive Oscillation Token Metabolism

This universe assumes dynamic, non-linear token flows to reflect adaptive oscillations between resource stability and volatility, enabling rapid response to changes.

Key Principles:
	•	Volatility as a Feature: Token pathways dynamically oscillate between high engagement (growth phases) and stability (maintenance phases).
	•	Feedback Loops: Tokens serve as signals of DAO health, with metabolism rates adjusting in response to external and internal metrics.

Pathways:
	1.	Growth Phase:
	•	Token Minting:
	•	Boost rewards for participation during high-demand periods (e.g., large governance changes, DAO scaling).
	•	Incentives for onboarding and outreach (e.g., referral rewards).
	•	Token Sink:
	•	Premium access costs (rooms, namespace visibility).
	•	Burn for expanding resource use (e.g., temporary namespace allocation).
	2.	Stability Phase:
	•	Token Circulation:
	•	Base-level rewards for passive participation (e.g., low-tier governance votes).
	•	Minimal costs for regular operations (e.g., access to existing rooms).
	•	Token Burn:
	•	Maintenance costs for underused namespaces, rooms, or proposals.
	•	Penalties for hoarding or inactivity to reduce supply.
	3.	Signal-Based Metabolism:
	•	Feedback from Metrics:
	•	Token minting slows when participation saturates (diminishing returns).
	•	Token burning increases when demand for DAO resources spikes.
	•	Contextual Rewards:
	•	High ATY rewards for aligning with time-sensitive objectives.
	•	Higher burn rates for opportunistic actions (e.g., large-scale funding attempts during volatility).
	4.	Specialized Role Rewards:
	•	Token Minting:
	•	Role-specific ATY incentives for key functions (e.g., validators, decision architects).
	•	Token Burn:
	•	Specialized role users must pay maintenance costs for their privileges (e.g., validator upkeep).

End State:

Token flows in this universe are adaptive and cyclical, maintaining DAO health by oscillating incentives between stability and volatility. This enables flexible responses to growth, contraction, or external market shifts.

Comparison of Universes

Aspect	Universe 1: Nash Equilibrium	Universe 2: Adaptive Oscillation
Token Dynamics	Stable equilibrium, minimal oscillation.	Dynamic, oscillating between growth and stability.
Incentive Alignment	Long-term, steady alignment of individual and DAO goals.	Rapid, adaptive rewards for dynamic participation.
Governance	Predictable costs and returns for proposals.	Context-driven costs/rewards tied to DAO metrics.
Risk/Volatility	Low risk, steady metabolism.	Higher risk, rewards during growth phases.
DAO Scope	Best for DAOs with steady, predictable workloads.	Best for agile DAOs in volatile or growing fields.

Each universe offers unique pathways and trade-offs, depending on the DAO’s structure, goals, and operational dynamics.
