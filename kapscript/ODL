Here’s a detailed organizational diagram of the elements within the KAP ecosystem, structured in a hierarchy that reflects their interactions and roles. I’ll present it in ASCII art for clarity and alignment with your preferences.

Components Explained

1. Open Discourse License (ODL)
	•	Top-level principle governing decentralization, openness, and sovereignty over knowledge.
	•	Defines rules for how organizations and individuals interact with the ecosystem.

2. Knowledge Guilds
	•	Guilds are self-organizing bodies responsible for:
	•	Mentoring users and developers.
	•	Governing namespaces and their attached rooms.
	•	Curating and validating submissions within their domains.

3. Developers
	•	Build and maintain the KScript, KAP, and ODL-compliant software layers.
	•	Define system-level rules that guilds, rooms, and submissions must adhere to.

4. Submissions
	•	The atomic units of the system.
	•	Contain cryptographic hashes, metadata, content, and state, enabling:
	•	Proposal creation.
	•	Room and namespace governance.
	•	Sovereign peer-to-peer decision-making.

5. Rooms
	•	Dynamic discussion or action spaces that organize submissions and validation.
	•	Configured for:
	•	General discussion.
	•	Precipitation events.
	•	High-stakes validations or consensus proposals.

6. Namespace Hierarchies
	•	Structured layers of topics or organizational goals.
	•	Link rooms, submissions, and guilds to specific domains of knowledge or operations.

7. Users
	•	Base-level participants who:
	•	Interact with the system by posting, validating, or staking submissions.
	•	Can gain reputation and privileges as they engage meaningfully.

8. Node Operators
	•	Deploy and run KAP-compliant nodes to enforce rules, validate submissions, and propagate network changes.
	•	Ensure system robustness and decentralization.

9. Amethyst Token System
	•	Drives economic incentives for users, guilds, and developers:
	•	Burn tokens for validation or privilege escalation.
	•	Reward contributions or successful validations.
	•	Stake tokens to support submissions or governance proposals.

Key Interactions
	•	Users post submissions in rooms within namespaces governed by guilds.
	•	Submissions require validation from peers or node-level logic.
	•	Guilds curate namespaces and manage high-level governance using guild tokens.
	•	Node operators ensure system compliance and prevent spam by enforcing consensus rules.
	•	The Amethyst token system underpins all interactions, ensuring accountability and incentivizing quality.
