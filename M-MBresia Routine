Decentralized Peer-Driven Coordination App
==========================================

1. Scope
   -------
   - Objective: Enable decentralized, token-driven coordination for decision-making and event tracking.
   - Core Functionalities:
     * Peer Validation and Privilege Hierarchy (based on M-Mbresia).
     * Token Economy with Deflationary Cost Mechanics.
     * Grid-Based Session Propagation.
   - Target Audience: Decentralized communities needing transparent decision-making.
   - Use Cases: Governance, project management, knowledge curation.

2. Intentions
   ------------
   - Systematize Blind Coordination: Allow meaningful user contributions without full visibility.
   - Promote Sustainable Engagement: Deflationary token model to regulate participation costs.
   - Support Non-Hierarchical Decision-Making: Meritocratic influence based on validation tokens.
   - Adapt to System Activity and Supply: Dynamic token economy based on user demand.

3. Methods
   --------
   - Token-Based Activity Tracking:
     * Activity tokens are emitted at regular intervals; consumption rates adjust based on supply.
   - Grid and Metadata Mapping:
     * User submissions route through a peer grid; events propagate until set criteria are met.
   - Peer Validation System:
     * Validation tokens grant privileges, enabling trusted users to influence propagation.
   - Deflationary Cost Multiplier:
     * Costs decrease as supply nears exhaustion, extending participation in scarce conditions.
   - Event Routing and Package Propagation:
     * Events route until they meet metadata conditions; then, summaries are published.

4. Prototype Applications
   -----------------------
   - Governance Application:
     * Community proposals, validated by peers, result in published summaries of decisions.
   - Project Management Tool:
     * Distributed task coordination with non-hierarchical validation and milestone tracking.
   - Knowledge Curation Platform:
     * Peer-validated content builds a shared database of high-quality entries.

Conclusion
-----------
This framework creates a sustainable, decentralized model for peer coordination, ideal for applications relying on blind peer validation and adaptive participation costs.
