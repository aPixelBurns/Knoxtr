- Fixed rule sets
- Clear accountability

**Recommended Settings:**
- Room Type: Action with Emergency elements
- Token Distribution: Scarce with high burns
- Validation Threshold: Time-sensitive
- Privacy Level: Public actions
- Governance: Leader-driven

### Pattern 4: Research and Validation
**Dominant D responses indicate:**
- Focus on quality and iteration
- Strong peer review
- Specialized participation
- Long-term perspective

**Recommended Settings:**
- Room Type: Research with Modular elements
- Token Distribution: Merit-based
- Validation Threshold: Iterative
- Privacy Level: Role-based
- Governance: Expert-driven

## Implementation Guidelines

### Initial Setup
1. Analyze response patterns
2. Identify primary configuration
3. Select appropriate room types
4. Configure token economics
5. Set validation rules

### Optimization Process
1. Monitor key metrics
2. Gather user feedback
3. Adjust parameters
4. Validate changes
5. Document outcomes

### Risk Mitigation
1. Anti-gaming measures
2. Privacy safeguards
3. Token stability mechanisms
4. Governance redundancy
5. Emergency protocols
