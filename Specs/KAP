KAP Metaprotocol Script Language Specification

The KAP Metaprotocol (Knoxtr-Amethyst-Peer) script language, hereafter referred to as KAP-Script, is a purpose-built, domain-specific language designed to enable asynchronous, distributed, and token-mediated coordination across multiple chaintips in a shared consensus space. The language must balance flexibility, verifiability, and extensibility to support the following core goals:
	1.	Multi-Tip Coordination: Interoperate seamlessly with Bitcoin (BTC), BTX, BCK, KNX, CTB, and other tips in KAP’s metaconsensus.
	2.	Token Dynamics: Facilitate the emission, burning, and transfer of Amethyst, ATY, VBC, and other tokenized assets.
	3.	State Mutability: Support state changes, precipitations, and entangled burn actions across namespaces and users.
	4.	Entropic Incentivization: Encode UTXO cleansing, chainstate entropy measures, and dynamic token issuance rules.
	5.	RGB and Asset Logic: Integrate with RGB standards for client-side smart contracts and asset minting.
	6.	Decentralized Identity: Enable metonymous (pseudonymous but reputation-bound) participation through node-level namespaces.
	7.	Memetic Evolution: Encode turn-based, token-mediated interaction cycles for emergent behaviors and decision-making.

Key Features and Concepts

1. Data Types

	•	Primitive Types:
	•	uint256: Unsigned 256-bit integers for hash and token values.
	•	bool: Boolean values for conditionals.
	•	bytes: Arbitrary byte arrays for signatures, hashes, or metadata.
	•	string: UTF-8 encoded strings for human-readable metadata.
	•	Compound Types:
	•	UTXO: Represents unspent transaction outputs with fields like value, scriptPubKey, and status.
	•	Namespace: Tracks metadata and burn history for registered identities.
	•	Token: Represents balances and state of tokens like Amethyst, ATY, or VBC.
	•	Specialized Types:
	•	Chaintip: Identifies tips by hash, block height, and state.
	•	Precipitation: Represents aggregated burn events and entangled actions.
	•	EntropyState: Tracks UTXO entropy and chainstate cleansing measures.

2. Core Instructions (Opcodes)

The KAP-Script opcodes are designed for chain-agnostic coordination, ensuring compatibility across all tips in the ecosystem.

Token Operations:

	•	OP_BURN [token] [amount] [namespace]
Burn tokens to trigger namespace updates or other actions.
	•	OP_MINT [asset] [amount] [entropy_state]
Mint new assets compliant with chainstate entropy rules.
	•	OP_TRANSFER [token] [to_namespace]
Transfer tokens between namespaces or across tips.

Namespace Management:

	•	OP_REGISTER_NAMESPACE [namespace_id] [metadata]
Register or update a namespace, burning Amethyst as a fee.
	•	OP_SYNC_NAMESPACE [namespace_id] [status_hash]
Synchronize namespace status across nodes in the system.

Multi-Tip Coordination:

	•	OP_VERIFY_CHAINTIP [chaintip_hash]
Verify a chaintip’s state and synchronize cross-tip actions.
	•	OP_ENTANGLE_BURN [token1] [token2] [ratio]
Link burn actions across tips with a specified token exchange ratio.

RGB Asset Logic:

	•	OP_ISSUE_ASSET [RGB_contract] [mint_logic]
Issue assets under an RGB-compliant smart contract.
	•	OP_REVOKE_ASSET [asset_id]
Revoke or invalidate a minted asset.

Memetic Evolution:

	•	OP_INITIATE_TURN [submission_hash] [burn_event]
Start a turn in a token-mediated interaction cycle.
	•	OP_RESOLVE_TURN [submission_hash] [resolution_data]
Resolve a turn, updating state and distributing rewards.

3. State and Execution Model

Execution Layers:

	•	Tip-Local Execution: Scripts execute locally on individual tips, interacting with their UTXO sets and token states.
	•	Metaconsensus Execution: Scripts can propagate state changes across tips, ensuring consistent namespace and token dynamics.

State Variables:

	•	Chaintip States: Track each tip’s height, entropy, and namespace synchronizations.
	•	Namespace Registry: Stores metadata, burn history, and privileges for all registered namespaces.
	•	Global Entropy State: Monitors UTXO cleansing and dynamic adjustments for ATY emission.

Verification:

	•	Every opcode execution must pass cryptographic checks for signatures, chain states, and token balances.
	•	Scripts must adhere to pre-defined rulesets per token or namespace to ensure compatibility.

4. Precipitation Events

Definition:

Precipitation events are aggregated actions triggered by token burns or other state transitions. These events propagate through the network to update namespaces, mint assets, or adjust chaintip dynamics.

Types:

	•	Burn-Based Precipitations: Triggered by Amethyst or ATY burns, impacting token emissions or privileges.
	•	Entropy-Based Precipitations: Adjust ATY issuance based on UTXO entropy levels.
	•	Cross-Tip Synchronizations: Align namespaces and states across multiple tips.

Sample Script

Minting ATY Based on Entropy

OP_VERIFY_CHAINTIP 0xabc123  // Verify current chaintip
OP_SYNC_NAMESPACE "node123" // Synchronize namespace for updates
OP_BURN ATY 1000 "node123"  // Burn 1000 ATY for minting process
OP_CALCULATE_ENTROPY 0xabc123  // Fetch entropy state from chaintip
OP_MINT ATY 5000 "node123"  // Mint 5000 ATY proportional to entropy state
OP_ENTANGLE_BURN ATY VBC 1:5 // Link burn actions across ATY and VBC

Design Goals Recap

	1.	Ensure seamless multi-tip coordination through interoperable opcodes.
	2.	Enhance token-mediated memetic evolution by encoding flexible interaction mechanisms.
	3.	Integrate with existing Bitcoin and RGB standards to future-proof the protocol.
	4.	Leverage chainstate entropy and dynamic feedback to align incentives across participants.
	5.	Create a transparent, verifiable, and adaptable scripting framework for emergent coordination.

KAP-Script empowers the Knoxtr-Amethyst-Peer ecosystem to scale distributed consensus, creativity, and token utility within a coherent yet chaos-responsive system.
