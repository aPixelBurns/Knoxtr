Tree of Concept

1. Hierarchies of Modes in Token Issuance

	•	1.1 Fixed Issuance
	•	Static allocation per epoch.
	•	Linear distribution schedule.
	•	1.2 Elastic Issuance
	•	Dynamic issuance tied to room activity.
	•	Token inflation controlled by participation rate.
	•	1.3 Conditional Issuance
	•	Event-based triggers for token creation.
	•	Example: Precipitation thresholds or collective actions.
	•	1.4 Reputation-based Issuance
	•	Weighted by user contribution scores.
	•	Token allocation proportional to earned privileges.

2. Mutation Orchestration

	•	2.1 Token Conversions
	•	Direct exchanges between token types.
	•	Context-specific conversion rules (e.g., Amethyst ↔ VBC).
	•	2.2 Burn-and-Create Mechanisms
	•	Token burns triggering new token types.
	•	Value redirection through destruction thresholds.
	•	2.3 Conditional Mutation
	•	Actions triggering token metamorphosis.
	•	Example: Role-action tokens mutating upon validation.
	•	2.4 Dynamic Reallocation
	•	Reweighting token balances based on interaction feedback.
	•	Incentive recalibration through algorithmic consensus.

3. Room Administration Hooks

	•	3.1 Setting Parameters
	•	Define room-specific token rules (e.g., burn thresholds).
	•	Adjust privileges and governance metrics.
	•	3.2 DHT Interaction Controls
	•	Allocate DHT real estate through Amethyst burns.
	•	Manage cross-room precipitate flows.
	•	3.3 Submissions Validation
	•	Moderation using token-gated peer review.
	•	Assign validation tokens for contributions.
	•	3.4 Orchestration of Precipitates
	•	Synchronize room events to incentivize desired outcomes.
	•	Trigger cascading token flows for milestone achievement.

4. Discussion Goals

	•	4.1 Structured Debate
	•	Goal: Clarify consensus through tokenized engagement.
	•	Metrics: Precipitate clarity and peer validation.
	•	4.2 Innovation Challenges
	•	Goal: Foster ideation via competitive incentives.
	•	Metrics: Token rewards for novel precipitates.
	•	4.3 Community Governance
	•	Goal: Define collective decisions via voting tokens.
	•	Metrics: Participation rates and resolution efficiency.
	•	4.4 Knowledge Sharing
	•	Goal: Build shared understanding through token-curated content.
	•	Metrics: Quality-adjusted validation flow.

5. Actionable Precipitate

	•	5.1 Token Reward Allocation
	•	Precipitate determines next token flow direction.
	•	Redistribution rules encoded by precipitation event.
	•	5.2 Room Evolution
	•	Trigger room state changes (e.g., forks, splits).
	•	Cascade to interlinked rooms.
	•	5.3 DHT Memory Update
	•	Finalize submissions in DHT as permanent records.
	•	Enable cross-room context sharing through indexed precipitates.
	•	5.4 Action Consensus
	•	Enact community-endorsed tasks or proposals.
	•	Incentivize execution using targeted token burns.

6. Standard Submission JSON Metafields

	•	6.1 Metadata
	•	Cryptographic hash: Submission ID.
	•	Author: Pseudonymous attribution or signature.
	•	6.2 Content
	•	Payload: Submission text, media, or data.
	•	Validation criteria: Required inputs for approval.
	•	6.3 Interaction
	•	Peer feedback: Upvotes, downvotes, comments.
	•	Token actions: Burns, issuances, or mutations triggered.
	•	6.4 State
	•	Status: Pending, validated, or precipitated.
	•	Token flow context: Linked issuance/mutation record.
