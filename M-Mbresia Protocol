Summary of Key Functionalities Across Tokens

	1.	Future Flows:
	•	Many tokens (e.g., Spark, Synthesize, Predict) create new pathways or threads, ensuring discussions evolve meaningfully over time.
	•	Debate and criticism tokens regulate the flow and resolution of conflicting ideas, improving coherence in discussions.
	2.	Metadata Affixing Strategies:
	•	Every token adds targeted metadata to submissions, such as hierarchical relationships (Decompose), summaries (Summarize), or critical flags (Expose).
	•	Metadata enriches the context and aids in navigating complex discourse.
	3.	Bounty Offerings:
	•	Tokens incentivize user contributions by rewarding impactful actions, such as resolving debates, producing clear models, or uncovering hidden assumptions.
	•	Rewards are tailored to each domain, balancing short-term engagement (e.g., Spark) with long-term value (e.g., Predict).

This system ensures that every mode of discourse—whether generating new ideas, resolving disagreements, or rigorously analyzing content—is supported and incentivized through Knoxtr-Amethyst’s tokenized framework.
